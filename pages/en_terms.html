                                above-mentioned items. (f) You have the right to ask any user to inspect the parcels and
                                their contents prior to pickup and to ensure that there are no prohibited materials that
                                fall under clause 2.9 below.

                    <p>
                        Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a
                        civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator
                        selected by the parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against the Company.
                        Agreeing to arbitration only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be
                        resolved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based upon the circumstances
                        presented, you will be required to split the cost of any arbitration with the Company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Arbitration will require you to resolve any claim that you may have against the Company on
                        an individual basis, except as provided below, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement unless you
                        choose to opt out of the Arbitration Provision. Except as provided below, this provision will
                        preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative against the Company, and
                        also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class,
                        collective, or representative action brought against the Company by someone else.

                    <p>
                        You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
                        the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the
                        Waddili Platform or Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration
                        between you and any relevant Affiliate in your jurisdiction, or between you and Waddili if no
                        other Affiliate is incorporated in your jurisdiction, except that each party retains the right
                        to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the
                        actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights,
                        trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You acknowledge and agree that you and Waddili are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
                        to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative
                        proceeding.

                    <p>
                        Further, unless both you and the relevant Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
                        may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
                        of any class or representative proceeding.

                    <p>
                        If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution"
